# ándaga-core

ándaga-core is the api and core engine for my [ándaga](https://wiki.chronica.xyz/#andaga) time tracking system.

Below are the existing routes at this point

  - `GET /categories` used to receive a list of all categories that have been used
  - `GET /log` used to retrieve a certain amount of logs specified by an `amount` parameter
  - `POST /log` used for storing logs
  - `GET /projects` used to receive a list of all projects that have been used
  - `GET /tags` used to receive a list of all tags that have been used

You can find out more about this project [here on my wiki](https://wiki.chronica.xyz/#andaga-core).
