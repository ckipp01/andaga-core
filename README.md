# ándaga-core

ándaga-core is the api and engine for my [ándaga](https://wiki.chronica.xyz/#andaga) time tracking system.

The api is currently small and only has 3 routes defined.

  - `GET /category` used to receive a list of all categories that have been used
  - `POST /log` used for storing logs
  - `GET /recall` used for recalling the last entry

You can find out more about this project [here on my wiki](https://wiki.chronica.xyz/#andaga-core).
